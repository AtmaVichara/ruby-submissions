### Team It - Marshall Houston, 1708 BE

### Pitch

Athletic directors and youth sports coaches are constantly on the go and need a fast and seamless way to communicate with parents, players, and other stakeholders. "Team It" allows a coach to send a text to a team number that automatically sends the message to anyone who has subscribed to this message feed. By removing communication barriers, athletic directors and coaches can focus on the things that matter: developing championship caliber teams!

In future iterations, Team It will provide platform for registration, scheduling, and stats tracking. It will add integration to TeamSnap and GameChanger applications that many coaches currently use.

### Problem

Coaches need to communicate with parents and players in an instant when practice and game times change, and they need this communication to happen instantaneously while on the go. Current applications require logging into separate portals that are better suited for other tasks, so Team It allows coaches to send a text to a single number and be confident that this communication is immediately received.

### Solution

When a coach creates a team, they receive a team # from Twilio that is used to communicate with parents and players. Parents and players subscribe to this number, so any communication from the coach is texted to them.

Team It seamlessly integrates into the day to day texting that we've come to expect, and it allows coaches to keep their personal numbers separate from team communication.

### Target Audience

The main target audience is youth sports coaches and athletic directors. Parents and players will also use Team It to communicate safely with a coach.

### New Techniques

I'm hoping to build this application using JavaScript with Node.js and Express.js on the backend. The front end will also be written in JavaScript using jQuery. If time permits, I'd like to learn React.

I will use Twilio API to setup the SMS (texting) features.

Eventually, I'd like to integrate the TeamSnap API and GameChanger API to give coaches a single platform for all their services.

### Workflow

I will use Waffle as a project management tool.
