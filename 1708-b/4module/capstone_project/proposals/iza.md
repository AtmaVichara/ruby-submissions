### Jet for GILT

### Pitch

Jet is a platform for users to be able to coordinate their outfits based on hospitality venues and restaurants they plan to visit. Users can search for venues based on their location, be it by city or zip code, and view premier venues for that location. As a user visits a venue's page, they're served fashion suggestions based on characteristics specific to that venue.

### Problem

It happens all the time - we make plans to go to dinner with a significant other, or plan a trip abroad with friends, but when it comes to planning and figuring out what to wear it becomes a whole other ordeal.

### Solution

This app serves to solve the problem of having to figure out what to wear when you have no idea what a venue's attire is. This app makes those suggestions that you can actually purchase, or just use to get an idea of what outfits would work for any given venue.

### Target Audience

This app is built with socialites and jet-setters in mind, but is also suitable for those who simply looking for venues to visit.

### New Techniques

For new techniques I plan to improve the current user experience by using JavaScript and jQuery for the front-end, utilize OpenAPI as documentation for Rails API, and incorporate registration notifications for new users by using background workers.
