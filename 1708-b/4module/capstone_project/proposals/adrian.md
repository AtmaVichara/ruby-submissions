### Project Template

### (name pending)

### Pitch

(name pending) is an app that streamlines the research that goes into visiting a specific business or place-of-interest.

### Problem

When I plan trips, there's a lot of work put into ensuring activities are optimally planned so that time well is spent.  This requires a lot of research even when I've already identified places of interest. I visit anywhere between 4 to 5 different websites to research everything from typical weather, typical traffic patterns, reviews, hours of operation, and any potential coupons.

### Solution

Rather than visiting multiple sites, this application collects all that information and presents it all in one place.

### Target Audience

This is for all the travelers, itinerary-makers, and anyone else looking to ensure their time and energy in visiting a place is well spent.

### New Techniques

I'll build this as a single page app using React on the frontend that consumes a backend in Rails.  I'll also incorporate Kubernetes to help automate deployment and/or scaling.
