## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations
## Meets Expectations
It works locally with full functionality, but not in production. CORs issues, we think? But it's completely functional in terms of code build. 

- Below Expectations

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
## Meets Expectations
Documentation is fairly thorough for both backend and frontend, including description of the purpose and tech stacks, API usage/routes, how to set up, and how to contribute. 

- Below Expectations

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Above Expectations
## Meets Expectations
Project is styled and decent looking. Relatively clean and uncluttered. Classes and IDs follow kebab case convention.

- Below Expectations

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
## Meets Expectations
Includes alt tags, image descriptions, and you can tab throughout the app for usage. 

- Below Expectations

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
## Below Expectations 
We probably could have done better splitting things out into files, and there is some mixing of ES5 and ES6, and not everything is super DRY or split out. 

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations
## Meets Expectations
We used master for production, used feature branches, PRed regularly.  We commented back and forth when we weren't together, and used PRs to request peer feedback as well. 

- Below Expectations

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Above Expectations
## Meets Expectations
We used Waffle.io to track our progress.  We assigned tasks when appropriate, moved tasks throughout the flow of the Waffle, closed cards either manually or through Github. 

- Below Expectations

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Above Expectations
## Meets Expectations
We reached out when we needed it, often pulling Amy or Cory in for assistance when we were stuck. 

- Below Expectations
