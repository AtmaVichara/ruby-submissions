## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the following criteria:


### 1. Feature Completeness

* Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented


### 2. Views

* Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s)

### 3. Controller

* Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring


### 4. Models

* Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

### 5. ActiveRecord

* Below Expectations: Ruby is used to programatically solve problems where ActiveRecord could be used

### 6. Testing

* Below Expectations: Project has sporadic use of tests

### 7. Usability

* Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready


### 8. Workflow

* Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
