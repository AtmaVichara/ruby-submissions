* Repo: https://github.com/Vadlusk/enigma/

* Notes:

* decrypt.rb file io not working
* Enigma.encrypt not working in pry
* ^working in tests
* Only Enigma class
* Tests error out in Rake
* Tested different lengths of messages, nil, tested upper case
* Lots of helper methods. Could have factored out into other classes
