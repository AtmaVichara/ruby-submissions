* Repo: https://github.com/Vadlusk/enigma/

* Notes:

* decrypt.rb file io not working
* Enigma.encrypt not working in pry
* ^working in tests
* Only Enigma class
* Tests error out in Rake
* Tested different lengths of messages, nil, tested upper case
* Lots of helper methods. Could have factored out into other classes

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 2

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
* Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
* Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
* Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
* Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used only when necessary)
* Code is indented properly
* Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
* Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories
* Code has been linted and corrected properly.

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 2

* Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
* Developer writes methods less than 8 lines
* Methods do not break the principle of SRP

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development: 2

* Each method is tested  
* Functionality is accurately covered
* Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
* Balances unit and integration tests
* Evidence of edge cases testing
* Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
* Test Coverage metrics exceed 95%

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

### 4. Git Workflow: 3

* Repository demonstrates that each member of team has contributed fairly equally.
* Developers commit at a rate of approximately one commit every 30 minutes.
* Repository shows the use of branches.
* Developers use a pull request workflow.
* Developers resolve HoundCI complaints in their pull requests.

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

### 5. Functionality: 2

* Application meets all requirements (extensions not required for a 3)

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations
