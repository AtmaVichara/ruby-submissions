Notes: 
* 53 tests, all passing
* Overall well structured, some methods are doing too much and are long
* Tests are well structured, although there is some redundancy and would
like to see more things checked in tests, such as sequence, and the data is
what we expect it to be.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations

* Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
* Ruby methods used are logical and readable
* Code is indented properly
* Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
* Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
* Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
* No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

* 3: Meets expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* Each method is tested  
* Tests implement Ruby syntax & style
