### Notes:

* Nice to see Response as Module. While it might not be the *best* case to use a module, it is good to see you thinking about how to use not only classes but Modules and/or superclasses to refactor code.
* Great job separating out functionality into classes
* Style looks good. It is clear that you are thinking about the best and/or most readable way to write code, not just code that works

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations

- [x] Developer implements best-choice enumerable methods
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] A directory/file structure provides basic organization via lib/ and/or /test

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 7 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development: 3

- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [x] Balances unit and integration tests
- [x] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [x] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
- [x] A test RakeTask is implemented

### 4. Functionality: 3

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

### 5. Version Control: 3

- [x] Developer commits at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
- [x] Developer implements branching and PRs
- [x] The final submitted version is merged into master
