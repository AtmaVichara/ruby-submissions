Notes:  
2 1 3 4 5
Class files and test files have "class" in filename
Some instance variable used where local variables would do  
Some single letter variables  
Used one attr_reader and mostly attr_accessors
Needs more edge case testing and could have some more robust assertions

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 2: Below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

** Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  **
** Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately **
** Naming follows convention (is idiomatic) **
* Ruby methods used are logical and readable
* Code is indented properly
* Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
** Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories**

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
* Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
* No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* Each method is tested  
* Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

### 4. Functionality

* Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
