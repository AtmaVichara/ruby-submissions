2 test files erroring out  
Some places using instance variables where locals would do
Working through Iter 4
Talked about some adjustments in naming and matching methods asked for in the spec  
One class file doesn't match file name
Test files written with test_something.rb pattern

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 2: Below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
** Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately**
* Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
* Ruby methods used are logical and readable
* Code is indented properly
* Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
** Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories**

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
* Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
* No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development

** Each method is tested  **
* Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   

### 4. Functionality

** Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)**
