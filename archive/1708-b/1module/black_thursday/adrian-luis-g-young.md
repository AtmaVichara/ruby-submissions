Working through iteration 4  
Breaks law of demeter  
Great job with enumerable choice  
Testing methods from SalesAnalysis and not from individual classes  


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

*   2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

*   3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development

*   3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 4. Functional Expectations

*   3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

*   4: Zero complaints

### 6. Version Control  

* 3: Student utilizes git workflow essentials, committing frequently to document progress
