**Notes:** 

Functionality is almost on-par; read the spec carefully for running instructions; ship placement; error messages
Only 26 tests but all methods covered (this is a result of insufficient breaking logic moreso than poor testing)
Some methods are bulky and overly-responsible but you identified this was a result of end-of-project rush & easily identified opportunities for improvement
