**Instructor:** Victoria
**Repo URL:** https://github.com/Heybluguy/battleship
**Notes:** 

1 commit; commits will help improve the ability to collaborate with others & access former code you may want to go back to
Be sure to read the spec carefully for instruction (should run with `ruby battleship.rb`)
Push yourself to start with testing; it will help reassure that your pieces are working when you make changes, and approach the problem with smaller bite-size pieces
Your ruby style is looking pretty good! Nice naming, indentation and use of enums
