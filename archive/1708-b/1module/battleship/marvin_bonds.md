**Notes:** 

Be sure to read the spec carefully (ruby battleship.rb)
Your red-green-refactor pattern is necessary for success. Tests will help drive code into pieces & allow you to refactor successfully
Making many commits will give you the opportunity to go back to functional code if something goes wrong
Room to refactor method length (nested ifs, multiple responsibilities, etc.)
Ruby style is looking good! You're using many methods & passing information appropriately, great spacing & indentation, naming things descriptively
