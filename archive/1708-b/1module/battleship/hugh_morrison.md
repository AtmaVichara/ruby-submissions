**Notes:** 

Great job breaking classes into responsibility and testing each component individually (67 runs, 171 assertions!!); your OOP game is on point
Some methods need refactoring (too much responsibility, too long), but you properly identified opportunities for refactoring there 
Nice job working towards extensions! Be sure to read & re-read the spec for specific instructions (run `ruby battleship.rb`, send 'sunken ship messages'). Nice job displaying the computer board & having really specific errors.
