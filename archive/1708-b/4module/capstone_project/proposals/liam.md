### Project Template

### [Project Title]
BattleBuddy

### Pitch

  This is an app that will be the only alarm on the market that will set your wake-up time further back if weather and traffic conditions make your route longer than usual. Never be late again!

### Problem

  The problem is that sometimes, no matter how much planning and energy one puts into getting to work on time in the morning, extraneous factors out of anyone's control can delay one's trip. Another problem that can be hopefully solved by this application is that one often presses the snooze button without taking into full consideration what they are snoozing through.

### Solution

  The solution will be to create an application that will periodically query the google maps API or any other relevant traffic/weather data, and reset the alarm further back if the travel time will be unacceptably long. This application will also let you create your morning itinerary piece by piece, allowing you to snooze specific actions at the perfect time intervals.

### Target Audience

  People who experience long commutes with heavy traffic people who would not consider themselves  "early risers"

### New Techniques

  - Local mobile data caching
  - React with enzyme 
  - Back end Flask microservices
  - AWS Lamda (and maybe AWS machine learning)
  - Accessing built-in mobile components (hopefully no assembly required)

### Workflow

  Cards will be managed through Pivotal Tracker
