A business management tool for producers in the fashion industry to track progress of all designer clients and their styles throughout the production phase.

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

Producers in the fashion industry are primarily tracking the status of their work on paper, which is both inconvinient(takes forever to find the piece of information you're looking for) and unsafe(if office caught on fire, the business couldn't go on).

### Solution

My app will provide a place to store the information regarding production for each style. Producers will be able to access notes quickly and data will be stored remotely, which also makes it accessible from out of the office.

### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

Producers in the fashion industry. Future iterations may involve designers being able to log in to view the current status of their styles.

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?

I'll be using Rails for the backend and JavaScript for the front end. I'd like to use the Google Calendars API so producers could add events to their calendar through the app.
