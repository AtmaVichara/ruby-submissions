Notes:


1. Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord

4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

3. User Experience and Conventions

2: Appication is difficult to navigate, and may not follow RESTful conventions. This project may have limited styling.

4. Code Organization/Quality

3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

6. Working Collaboratively

4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
