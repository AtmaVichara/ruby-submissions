Notes:


1. Functional Expectations

2: Application has some small missing base functionality

2. ActiveRecord

3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the navbar.

4. Code Organization/Quality

4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.

5. Testing

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

6. Working Collaboratively

3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
