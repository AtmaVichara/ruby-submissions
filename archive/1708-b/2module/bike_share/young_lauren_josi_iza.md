Notes:


1. Functional Expectations

2: Application has some small missing base functionality

2. ActiveRecord

4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

3. User Experience and Conventions

2: Appication is difficult to navigate, and may not follow RESTful conventions. This project may have limited styling.

4. Code Organization/Quality

2: Code does not represent a significant effort to refactor. Logic leaks into the views or controllers. Long methods may exist, and the purpose behind some methods may be unclear.

5. Testing

1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

6. Working Collaboratively

2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
