Evaluation Rubric

Student: Aaron & Zach  
Evaluated By: Ali  
Notes:
Spec harness passing all assertions  
15 & 21 local tests  
Used Node & CompleteMe class
Some logic lives in Node, some in CompleteMe  - talked about consisitency  
They had thoughts on how to refactor.  
Methods look pretty clean, can tell thought was put into method naming  

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Ruby Syntax & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
