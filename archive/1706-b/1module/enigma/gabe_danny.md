Evaluation Rubric

Student: Gabe & Danny  
Evaluated By: Ali  
Notes:  
23 enigma tests
5 key tests
9 offset tests  
Close to full functionality - misses specifics of spec in a couple places, crack doesn't work from command line  
Encrypt a Decrypt are runner files - all logic lives on Enigma  
Efforts toward refactoring  - encrypt & decrypt well refactored, crack needs work - they identified this need as well.

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Ruby Syntax & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

4. Functional Expectations

2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
