Evaluation Rubric

Student:
Evaluated By: Mike
Notes:

* Tests were generally good, could go into a bit more detail with specific assertions.
* Code was separated well, a little too much reliance on ivars, code was
pulled out into methods that did not add to clarity.

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

# 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

# 2. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

# 3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

# 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
