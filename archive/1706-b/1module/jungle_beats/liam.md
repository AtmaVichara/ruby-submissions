Evaluation Rubric

Student: Liam
Evaluated By: Sal
Notes:

* Classes seem to be working well together.
* Classes should be broken into their own files to allow focus on one class at a time.
* `Jungle_beats_test.rb` file is not actually a test file.
* File naming should be snake case to follow Ruby conventions.
* Nice work to get the beat validation working.
* 2 on Ruby syntax and style due to single file/following conventions, not necessarily long methods/poorly named variables.

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

# 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

# 2. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

# 3. Test-Driven Development

1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

# 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
