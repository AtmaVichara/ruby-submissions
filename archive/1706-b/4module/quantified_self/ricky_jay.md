## Instructor Rubric

### Evaluated By: Lauren

### Notes:

  - inline edit doesn't persist change on refresh
  - new foods are appending to table as undefined
  - navigation back to diary from foods would be nice
  - calories aren't sorting foods on click
  - good error messaging when create food isn't valid
  - for accessibility - black text with a dark gray background is a little hard to read
  - your JS is so nicely refactored!
  - Really impressed by both client and server codebases
