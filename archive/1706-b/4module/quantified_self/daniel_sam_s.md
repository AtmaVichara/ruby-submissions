## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence


Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

We believe we met all the technical specs, with some strange behavior. Both backend and Frotnend services are deployed.

- Meets Expectations

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

Documentation is simple but effective.

- Meets Expectations

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

We modeled the ui from the spec mock-up, tho not with all the same colors and buttons.

- Meets Expectations

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

Site is tab-able.

- Above Expectations

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

Though, this is our first JS project, syntax is mostly consistent.

- Meets Expectations

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

Git workflow leveraged PRs, branches, and Reviews.

- Above Expectations

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Meets Expectations

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

We communicated thoroughly with teammates, and when we needed clarification we reached out to our team-lead.

## Instructor Rubric

### Evaluated By: Lauren

### Notes:

- delete from meal is a little buggy - sending 2 requests
- delete from diary sends 4 requests
- delete from meal doesn't remove from DOM - need page refresh to clear
- edit from both diary and foods page is not working
- button to link to /foods doesn't reroute correctly in production
- sort by calories is not working
- total calories on diary not changing with food updates
- add food to meal doesn't append to DOM - need page refresh to show
  - also isn't updating remaining calories for meal
- validation alerts for adding new food is buggy
  - also, should be text under the input, not a browser alert
- client code could use a lot of refactoring...lots of heavy functions there
- server code looks good, well-organized
