## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

All functionality is working. There is a small bug that occurs on the diary page when attempting to add foods that requires a
refresh to make it work. If you add multiple foods, to a meal it works just fine. If you only add a single food, the page needs to be refreshed.

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

We have included all instructions necessary for visiting the production sites and how to get the repos cloned and started. We have included a brief description of the project as well as endpoints available and links to both the frontend and backend reops on both sites.

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

We added a navbar to make it easier for the user to navigate between the two pages easily. We added some styling to make out page layout look nice and believe the user experience is pretty good, although there are a few things that could be aligned better.

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Everything on the page is able to be tabbed through. We used axe to try and fix other accessibility issues that came up.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

**- Above Expectations**
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

We really worked hard on refactoring as we went and feel that our organization and breakdown of functions into smaller components is something we are really proud of. We used ES6 syntax throughout with regular function syntax on the front end. We wanted to try arrow syntax, so we used that on that backend.

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

We did use feature branches to changes and required the other partner to be the one who merged it to master. On a few occasions, we did push directly to master when both of us were sitting together and just needed a small fix such as forgetting to run npm build. While we did have a lot of conversation around our pr's it was usually done over slack or in person as opposed to on github. Our tech lead has commented on our pr's when requested.

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

We used waffle to track our progress. We used a feature of waffle that was new to us that allowed cards to be moved into review and closed automatically based on the way we named out pr's. We felt that we stayed on top of our waffle board pretty well and that it was an accurate picture of what each person was doing at any given time.

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Above Expectations
**- Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

We reached out to our technical lead whenever we had questions or needed clarification. We did this through pull requests a few times, but mostly it was in person. We also checked in with our tech lead a few times to make sure that what we were doing was aligned with expectation.

### Notes:

- would be great if adding a food didn't refresh the page
- great UI! love the navigation, styling and ease of use
- try to have more consistency between `import` and `require`
