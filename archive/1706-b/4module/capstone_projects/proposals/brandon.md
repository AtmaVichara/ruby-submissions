### Project Template

### Artbot

### Pitch

Can computers create abstract art that humans enjoy with the aid of human input?

### Problem

How can a computer generate random shapes and colors that appeal to humans?  How can users give a computer meaningful feedback when it creates an image?

### Solution

I am going to procedurally generate SVG shapes and colors using javascript.  These shapes and colors will be completely random at first and allow users to like or dislike images as they are generated.  Over time, the parameters will become less random based on the types of parameters used to generate images that users like.

### Target Audience

Anyone who likes looking at shapes and is interested to see what sort of strange things the computer will generate.  

### New Techniques

I am going to use the React Apollo stack (https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/full-stack-react-graphql-tutorial-582ac8d24e3b) using a React front end with a GraphQL backend.  I may change the GraphQL backend to use Rails as I learn more about GraphQL and see if it is the right tool for my use case.

### Workflow

What project management tool will you be using to manage your progress?

I will use a trello board to manage my workflow.
