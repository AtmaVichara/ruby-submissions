### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

SitterSwap aims to allow pet owners to take more vacations by reducing the high costs associated with pet boarding and pet sitting. Instead of paying a boarding facility or petsitter, SitterSwap allows you to watch another member's dog in your house while they are on vacation to earn credits that you can then use to have someone watch your dogs while you are on vacation. Members will never have to pay for dog boarding or pet sitting again.

Dog boarding and pet sitting are extremely expensive.

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?

I am going to build the frontend with react and I am going to attempt to build the backend with express. However, if after a week it doesn't seem like that will be possible, then I will switch the backend to rails. Since we have an extra week break, I figure this is doable.
