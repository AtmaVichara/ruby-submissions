### Project Template

### [Ask Randy]

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

"Ask Randy" will serve as a chatbot app intended for comedic purposes. 

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

Our constant exposure to negative news stories and/or continous endurance through stressful situations, whether it be certian work environments or coding schools like Turing, require outlets for stress relief. That could be physical exercise for some, going to the movies, drinking alcohol, etc. For the Turing student, having a healthy outlet for stress relief is instrumental in order to maintain a well balanced mental state and to avoid burning out while undergoing the arduous process that is Turing. 

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

While intended for anyone's use, the "Ask Randy" app will serve as a chatbot that will interact with users providing them with comedic conversations, that will be appropriate and avoid foul and obscene language, making it a perfect tool for comedic entertainment.

### Target Audience

Mostly Turing students and developers as I plan to program the bot to respond to mostly key words related to programming.
