### Project Template

### Movie Machine

### Pitch

This application allows users to discover new movies that they may not have known about using algorithms that learn the user's preferences.

### Problem

Movies can be great pieces of art but watching them is an investment of time. Watching a movie that is not something that you would like is a waste of time. There are so many bad movies out there on the streaming services, it's hard to find something you would like.

### Solution

The application will make use of the MovieLens dataset and be able to learn about a users preferences. It will be able to make recommendations of movies that the user would like and list what services they can see the movie on if any.

### Target Audience

This app would be targetted towards anyone that uses a streaming service, and geared towards cord cutters since they will have more services to make use of.

### New Techniques

iOS app development, python, machine learning

### Workflow

I will be using Waffle.io to do my project management.
