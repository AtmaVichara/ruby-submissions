### Project Template

### My Favorite Places

## Disclaimer: My primary goal for this project is to obtain some familiarity with new technologies that I've be interested in. As such, I am not aiming to create an app that people will use but rather one that will test the boundaries of my programming knowledge.

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?  

My Favorite places is an app that will be able to predict where you will go, at any given time, allowing your phone to predict important dates for you. 

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.  

The main problem I am trying to solve is gaining familiarity with the following technologies: mobile development with react native, GIS database development and basic machine learning through predictive software. My favorite places is my way of tying all of those technologies into one application.

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.  

The target audience will be anyone who has an android device and would like to obtain some data on their travelling/commutting habits. 

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?

I'm hoping to develop with react native which is something that I only have some small exposure to. I will try to build my backend using rails, hopefully adding a GIS/location component to the database. Finally I will create data fixtures to run through a predictive software that will analyze travel patterns and predict where you will go on any given day in the future. 

### Workflow

What project management tool will you be using to manage your progress?

Since I used waffle for quantified self I will want to use pivotal tracker for this go around since that will give me even exposure to both.
