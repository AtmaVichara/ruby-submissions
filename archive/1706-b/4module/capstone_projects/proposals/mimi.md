### room + mates

### Pitch

Let's admit it: finding a roommate is hard, let alone finding the _perfect_ roommate. 

Say good-bye to the days in which users have to browse the 'housing' section of Craigslist and go through tens- if not hundreds- of posts that offer a couple of shots of an empty room at different angles and a one-liner that typically reads: 'text this number if you're interested'. 

With **room + mates**, users can now build a profile, share photos, and connect with potential roommates who are most likely compatible to them based on geographical location and common interests. Finding the perfect roommate has never been easier!

### Problem

As rent continues to climb above national averages in many cities across the United States, living with a roommate has become a neccessity for many millennials. One will realize, however, as they embark on their co-living lifestyle, that finding the right place will not be the biggest challenge, but finding the right roommate.

Questions like: Is this person a night owl? Does this person work from home? Is this person a smoker? are all important questions to ask to screen out incompatible roommates. Unfortunately, most websites like Craigslist and roomiematch don't offer these types of services.

### Solution

**room + mates** differs from existing roommate finder services and applications for the following reasons:

  1. Users fill out a 'lifestyle/personality' questionnaire and are provided a list of compatible roommates based on their geographical location and common interests.
  2. Users can go through their list and 'thumbs up' potential roommates. If the person renting a space and the person looking to rent a space both give each other the 'thumbs up', they unlock the chat feature which will allow them to talk over the **room + mates** messenging app.
