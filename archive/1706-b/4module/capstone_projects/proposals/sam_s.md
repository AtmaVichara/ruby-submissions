### Project Template

### Track What you like

### Pitch

Creating walkthroughs from users, and maybe API/web parsing.

### Problem

Recipes, guides to games, and other activities are all available online, but maybe not in a format that is transferable among all of them.

### Solution

My application will allow other users to post 'WalkThru's, and use others'.

### Target Audience

Anyone who likes to use guides.

### New Techniques

Integration with android development tools and java.

### Workflow

Waffle
