### Project Template

### Understanding the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(I need a better project title)


### Pitch

The site will provide aggregate information and analysis on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act so that individuals interested in understanding this bill can go to one resource online to learn more about the bill's contents and its impact.

### Problem

Though there is a lot of information online about the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there aren't that many sites where individuals can go to to access a diverse set of information, analysis, and  opinions about the Tax bill.  

### Solution

The proposed website will have a page where users can assess how liberal and conservative print media and TV stations are covering the Tax Act. A separate page will focus on how people are reacting to the bill on social media and allow users to retweet information that they find useful. The site will also provide users with information on where the Tax bill currently stands in terms of passage and give them the ability to email their representatives with their views on the Tax bill.

### Target Audience

The target audience is anyone who is interested in better understanding the 2017 Tax Act.

### New Techniques

I will be using different APIs from news organizations, integrate the ability for users to send email messages to their representatives directly from the site, incorporate the Twitter API to follow social media discussions on the tax bill. The backend will be built using Rails and I will use JavaScript for the client-site.

### Workflow

I will use git for version control and pivotal tracker to track my progress on the project.
