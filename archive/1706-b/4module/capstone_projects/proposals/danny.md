### Project Template

### BlackJack

### Pitch
This is Blackjack! An interactive game that allows players to mimic a real life blackjack card-table playing against the dealer to win hands.

### Problem
The problem is there is a serious lack of things to do while having nothing else to do. This solves this problem by allowing users to enjoy playing the game while improving there skills for there next visit to Las Vegas. 

### Solution
This application will allow users to login, play the game of blackjack and track there skill improvement. It will also allow players to test there skills with other players around the same table. 

### Target Audience
The target audience will be anyone who is interested in playing or learning the game of blackjack. 
1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

### New Techniques
I will use React and Redux to both display and hold the game logic necessary to manage the deck of cards and dealer play. 
There will also be new challenges for me having multiple players in the same game on different browsers as well as hopefully integrating a chat feature between players. 

### Workflow
I will use pivotal tracker to track my progress with User stories.
