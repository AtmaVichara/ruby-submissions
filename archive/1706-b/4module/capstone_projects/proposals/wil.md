### Project Template

### @CheckIn

### Pitch

Seemlessly allow users to use facial recognition software on the back end of a client facing mobile application to take attendance of a medium size room with 10+ people with out having to call out names.

### Problem

Whether you are a teacher or the host of a company conference/meeting and you need to check in a group of people quickly and efficiently, the platform will allow you to use your exsisting panoramic camera to take a picture of a room and check in the attendees. Quickly giving the user an attendance feedback to the mobile application.

### Solution

Using Facial recognition software I will use that to import a picture, while extrapolating the faces of humans out, it will then take that picture and compare it back against the attendees imported pictures.

### Target Audience

Small to medium sized daily groups.
Classrooms
Conference Rooms
Meetings

### New Techniques

React-Native
Node JS API server
New API for facial recognition
