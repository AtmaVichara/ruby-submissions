### Project Template

### CanvassCoord (Or a much better name tbd, hopefully)

### Pitch

CanvassCoord is an application that provides a simple door-to-door canvassing toolset for political campaigns and private business operations. 

### Problem

Canvassing operations, in both the non-profit and for-profit world, can be complex and expensive undertakings and require siginificant organizational energy and structure for all parties involved. Here are some of the significant questions inherent in any canvassing operation:

For the canvasser: What addresses do I need to visit? How will I get there? Do I need to drag around large amounts of campaign literature or paperwork? Can I make each visit a pleasant experience for the homeowners?

For the canvass team-lead: How do I know my canvassers are visiting the correct addresses? Are they actually working? Will I need to sift through and organize physical paperwork, cash/check contributions and payments? etc.

For the director: Can I target specific households in a clear way? How do I maximize effective face-to-face interactions? How will I organize collected data in a way that makes it leverageable?

### Solution

CanvassCoord aims to help answer each of these questions and provide a simple, easy-to-use, and powerful set of tools that allow for efficient and effective delivery of canvassing capaigns. 

Individual canvassers use a React native app that tells them which households to visit, how to get to those households, what to ask when they are there, and allows them to take on the spot donations and payments.

Canvassing team-leads and campaign directors can set canvassing routes, manage interactions, and track and analyze data via a web-app served by a stand-alone, fast, scalable back end application.

### Target Audience

This application suite targets political campaigns (issue, candidate, etc.) as well as any applicable private businesses that engage in door-to-door visits.

### New Techniques

This application suite will utilize a React-Native app for canvassers, as well as an admin site built in React. Both front-end apps will be served by a Crystal backend. If Crystal is not capable, I will use a Go backend. If the scope of this project proves too large, the user and admin applications will be combined into one front-end.

### Workflow

I will use waffle.io to manage user stories and track progress.
