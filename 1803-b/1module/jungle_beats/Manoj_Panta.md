Notes:

* Methods are occasionally too interdependent
* Good use of the begin/rescue technique, but would have liked to seen that implemented througout the code.


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
* Ruby methods used are logical and readable
x Code is indented properly
* Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
* Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories


* 3: Meets expectations

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

x Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
x Developer writes methods less than 10 lines
* No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

* 2: Below expectations

### 3. Test-Driven Development

X Each method is tested  
* Tests implement Ruby syntax & style  

* 2: Below expectations

### 4. Version Control

Expectations:

* Developer commits at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
* Developer implements branching and PRs
* The final submitted version is merged into master
* 3: Meets expectations

### 5. Functionality

* Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
* 2: Below expectations
