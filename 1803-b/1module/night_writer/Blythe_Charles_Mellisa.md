Notes:
* Application does not run
* Tests are often missing the assertions necessary
* watch your whitespace and unnecessary line breaks in testing and in code
* remember SRP - Single Responsiblity Principle - when it comes to your code - methods should only do ONE thing per method, 

## Evaluation Rubric

- [ ] Functionality is accurately covered
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)


* 2: Below expectations

- [x] The final submitted version is merged into master



* 2: Below expectations

### 5. Functionality
