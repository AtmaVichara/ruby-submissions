Notes:
* Application mostly works
* LOTS of repetitive code
* Some unneccessary methods that dont do anything
* Application does not match the spec
* Runners should be able to use any file.
* Dictionary should be in separate file and use a reverse
* FIle IO in runners should be pulled out
* ~ GIT WORKFLOW ~
