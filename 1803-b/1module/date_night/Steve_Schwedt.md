Notes:

* Make sure you're committing smaller chunks of code. Make sure you're committing at least once per hour. 
* Need to be testing Node
* Your tests can also check structure of tree to be more explicit
* Good job edge case testing
* Make sure you're reading the spec carefully
* Don't store depth on nodes
* Ternarys a little confusing
