Notes:

* All Classes, i.e. Node should be tested
* Don't store depth in Node
* Name files test not tests
* Transposing Expected and Actual
* Assertions with arrays is too fancy
* Test insert should have more insertions
* Read spec more specifically
* Tests should be rigorous
* Tests can check structure of Tree
* @node_depth and @leaf_count
* Don't need return_leaves method
