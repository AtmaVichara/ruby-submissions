Notes:

* Should be testing all attributes
* It's nice to set IVars to nil to be explicit
* Remember to test as specifically as possible, i.e. checking tree structure versus just checking return value of insert
* Could make tests more rigorous i.e. runing include on full tree versus just a tree with a root
* Good refactor of compare_left/right
